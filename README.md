# About
This is my educational project in rewriting things in rust. This time i've chosen Karpatny's [**nanoGPT**](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT). I also wanted to give rust's [*Burn framework*](https://burn.dev) a try, so that seemed like a good choice for me.

# Running
Currently there is no ready to use release, so just wait

## Roadmap
